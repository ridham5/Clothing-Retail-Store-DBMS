# Clothing Retail Store DBMS Project

## Introduction
This project is a Database Management System (DBMS) designed to streamline the operations of a clothing retail store. It aims to optimize inventory management, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve operational efficiency by managing key business processes such as sales, inventory, and customer data.

## Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To build a robust and scalable database that supports the operations of a clothing retail store.
- To demonstrate the use of advanced database design principles, normalization techniques, and SQL queries.
- To create a user-friendly interface for managing the database using Oracle APEX.

## Key Features
- **Inventory Management**: Track product details, stock levels, and suppliers.
- **Sales Management**: Record transactions and payment methods.
- **Customer Management**: Maintain customer profiles and purchase histories.
- **Employee Management**: Store employee details, roles, and performance metrics.
- **Promotions Management**: Handle store promotions with discounts and expiry dates.
- **Advanced SQL Queries**: Analyze data through views and advanced queries.

## ER Model and Schema Design
The database is designed with normalization to ensure data consistency and eliminate redundancy. The ER model connects key entities such as customers, employees, products, suppliers, and transactions. 

## Why I Built This Project
This project was developed as part of a university course on Database Systems (CPS510). It demonstrates my understanding of database design, SQL, and integration with tools like Oracle APEX. The project reflects my ability to manage and execute real-world database applications.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/ridham5/Clothing-Retail-Store-DBMS.git
   cd Clothing-Retail-Store-DBMS
3. Import the database:
   Execute Database/schema.sql and Database/seed_data.sql in your Oracle database.
4. Set up Oracle APEX:
   Use the file APEX/application_export.sql to import the application into Oracle APEX
